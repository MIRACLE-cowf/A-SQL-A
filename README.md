## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction ðŸ‘‹  
Hello! I am a beginner developer who is greatly interested in the rapidly emerging field of LLMs.

This is my another basic starter project, created for the purpose of studying LLM prompting and Python for my own study.

Thank you for coming by, and please keep an eye out for future updates!
